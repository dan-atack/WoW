--------------PLANNING-------------------

THE GAME IS SPLIT INTO MULTIPLE SUB APPLICATIONS WITH A PARENT APP

    APP {
        CHARACTER BUILDER

        CHARACTER EDITOR

        CUTSCENE

        MINIGAME

        GAME
    }

THE GAME WILL BE UNIFIED BY A GLOBAL STATE VARIABLE FOR WHAT PORTION OF THE GAME THE APP IS IN

GLOBAL STATE WILL ALSO UNIFY DATA BETWEEN THE SUB-APPS DONE

-------------------CHARACTER BUILDER-------------------

CHARACTER BUILDER WILL BE AN INITIAL INTRODUCTION PART OF THE APP, WHERE THE PLAYER WILL SELECT WHAT KIND OF CHARACTER THEY ARE
AND WILL SEND THEM TO THE NEXT PORTION OF THE APP.

    PLAYERS WILL GET TO SEE THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE CHARACTERS AND THEIR PLAYSTYLES, PLAYERS WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE
    SKILL TREES OF THE CHARACTER (EDITED VERSION OF CHARACTER EDITOR, WHERE NO POINTS CAN BE ADDED OR TAKEN AWAY)

    ON SUBMIT IT WILL SET THE GLOBAL STATE VARIABLE TO THE CHARACTER TYPE, AND TELL THE PARENT APP TO MOVE TO THE NEXT PORTION OF THE APP (CUTSCENE - INTRO)

----------------------CUTSCENE---------------------------

CUTSCENE WILL BE A RECURRING PART OF THE APP, THE PLAYER WILL CLICK OR WAIT THROUGH SCENES GETTING TEXT PORTIONS OF THE STORY
AND SOMETIMES MAKING DECISIONS THROUGH TEXT CHOICES THAT CHANGE VARIOUS GAME STATES.

    CUTSCENE WILL BE A REUSABLE APPLICATION THAT'S GIVEN THE CURRENT STATE OF THE GAME VIA A 'STRING' AND THE 'STRING' WILL BE A
    KEYWORD THAT RETURNS AN ARRAY OF SCENES. 

    THE SCENES WILL HAVE THE CHARACTER PORTRAIT, DIALOG OPTIONS, TEXT, AND BACKGROUND IMAGE.

    THE KEYWORD WILL ALSO LET THE APP KNOW WHAT THE CHANGE THE CURRENT STATE OF THE GAME TO.

------------------------MINIGAME------------------------

MINIGAME IS CUTTING A PROMO, A GAME WHERE YOU WILL SELECT DECISIONS BASED ON QUESTIONS ASKED TO YOU

    THE ANSWERS THAT THE PLAYER CHOOSES WILL AFFECT THEIR KARMIC ALIGNMENT

    THE MORE OF THE SAME KARMIC ANSWERS THE CHARACTER GIVES, THE HIGHER THE VALUE IS.

    THE MINIGAME QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS WILL BE BASED ON GAME STATE SO THEY HAVE CONTEXT TO THE STORY.
